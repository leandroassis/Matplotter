# **Matplotter** - *Functions Chart Generator*
### Made by: Leandro Assis

## Introduction

This project has the goal of being my conclusion work of *Computação 1*.
This software use concepts and learnings acquired during the discipline of *Cálculo I*. It's very important to read the help file (ajuda.txt) before doing operations because I have used [sympy](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html) python's module, and it's strictly necessary to write the equations as the module requires.

You can find some examples in the demonstration folder.

## Requirements

Beyond sympy module, I've used some others python's modules as written below:

1. [Sympy](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html)
2. [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)
3. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
4. Os and random (already comes with python)

## Notes

This was my first python project, and I was very happy with the results. I hope you enjoy it. :)
